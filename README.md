# QKD_image_encryption
This encryption technique is implemented in the context of a hybrid quantum-classical cryptosystem in which a Quantum Key Distribution protocol is combined with the logistic sine map to establish a secure image transmission scheme. The QKD scheme derived from <sup>[1]</sup> employs a tripartite entangled state to double the key length compared to the conventional E91 protocol and can effectively detect any eavesdropping activities through the CHSH inequality violation. The increased key size is then utilized to generate a chaotic sequence employing the logistic sine map. The image is converted into grayscale before applying the XOR operation. Finally, Bob decrypts the image using the identical seed and parameter value.
